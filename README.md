# Disaster_Tweets_LSTM

Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets aims to classify messages on Twitter that describe actual emergencies versus non-emergencies, even when they use disaster-related language. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, this project processes and analyzes text data to effectively distinguish between true disaster-related tweets and non-disaster tweets.
